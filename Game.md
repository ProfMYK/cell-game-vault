A UI / Puzzle game where you start as a [[Cell]] and you have to design your own [[Protein]] you put the design in you [[Ribosomes]] and they will automatically [[Protein]] for you.

You design your [[DNA]] to design your [[Protein]] and you have a [[Skill Tree]] where you can choose what kind of [[Cell]] you mutate to be. You start as a [[Prokaryotic Cell]] and a [[Heterotroph]] but you can mutate to becoming [[Autotroph]] or mutate to a [[Eukaryotic Cell]] and have your own [[Mitochondria]] and other cool stuff that will automate some things like producing [[ATP]] which you need to do most things in the game.

You gain important materials like [[Minerals]], [[Amino Acid]], [[Carbohydrates]] and [[Lipids]] from outside you can't make these by your self at the start of the game but you can mutate yourself from the [[Skill Tree]]. After you have grown a lot and you have a component like [[Lysosome]] you can eat other cells around you and gain materials from them.

Every run is around 20 minutes (there is some randomness) and after the run ends you restart but you keep your [[DNA]] and [[Skill Tree]].
